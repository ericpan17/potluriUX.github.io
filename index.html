Our JS UX design team consists of team of 4 awesome ninja developers. We've worked on lots of different types of projects throughout our careers, such as Ebooks, Reporting, Animations, Shops, advertising, book covers, brochures, comic books, corporate identities and logos, DVDs and videos, outdoor signage, packaging, point-of-purchase displays, style guides, websites and more. 
</p><p>
We brainstorm, research, wireframe, design and refine user experiences; all within specified product requirements and deadlines. Deliverables include wireframes, workflow diagrams, mockups and design specifications required for proper implementation. We provide end to end solutions to websites including hosting, database, backend programming and ofcourse great front end design, programming!
</p><p>
We believe in showcasing our work. Please check out our Ebooks, Reports and Shop Sections for some good frontend work. 
There are so many amazing people out there who have created excellent front end libraries without which we could never have created any of the stuff we did. We have so much more work to show just shoot us an email if you have questions.
